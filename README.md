## How to Play
Open the web application in a browser.
Player 1 (X) makes the first move by clicking on any empty cell.
Player 2 (O) takes the next turn.
The game continues until one player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or the board is full (tie).
Click the "Restart" button to reset the board and play again.

## Future Enhancements
Single-Player Mode: Add an option to play against a computer/AI.
Score Tracking: Implement a system to track wins, losses, and ties.
Animations: Add smoother transitions and effects for better user experience.
